Motion planning using primitives reduces the search space from an infinite dimensional nonlinear search to a combinatorial search over finite dimensions.

Planning using primitives relies on the coverage and optimality of the primitives being used, as well as the method by which they are preferred over one another.


Planning using primitives is most successful when the on-line computation required per primitive is small (mention affine?) and the search is guided (i.e. orderings).

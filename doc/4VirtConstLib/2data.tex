As discussed in the Section \ref{sec:algreqs}, the selection algorithm's ability to efficiently and practically produce sequences of motion primitives places requirements on the virtual constraint library to include particular data per VC. This data is critical to the success and practicability of the virtual constraints method of path planning. The data associated with each constraint is presented in Table \ref{tab:datavc}

	\begin{tabular}{ c | c | c | c }
		Data                               & Description               & Type                      & Storage method \\ \hline
		$\Gamma(\theta^c), \Psi(\theta^c)$ & Partial sol at crit point & Floating-point            & Per VC         \\

		$\Gamma(\theta^+), \Psi(\theta^+)$ & Partial sol after impact  & Floating-point            & Per VC         \\

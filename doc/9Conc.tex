\section{Contribution of this work to state of the art}
Synthesize advantages and disadvantages -- trajectory of field and its promise. Maybe here, at the end of this section?

\section{Future work}
Go wild here.

\begin{itemize}
	\item 3D
	\item Experimentation/physical realisation
	\item High-level planner - starting and stopping, achieving some desired gait characteristics etc.
	\item Fail-safes
	\item Feet
	\item Optimisation of constraint with better specified path of end of foot?
	\item Bounding/running
	\item More efficient optimisation (in C, not MATLAB?)
	\item Impulsive toe-offs to improve efficiency?
	\item Produce constraints based on real-world ground data?
	\item Transverse linearisation controller
	\item Genuine flexible IK calculation for building of $\tilde{Q}$.
\end{itemize}

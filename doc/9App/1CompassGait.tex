The compass-gait walker is useful as an instructive example, since the derivation of relevant dynamics and application of virtual constraints is relatively simple, but it is straightforward to understand how the principle may be extended to more complex systems. This section details the application of the principles discussed in this thesis to the simple case of the saggital-plane compass-gait walker.

For different examples on the CG and 5L:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completion over different terrains
	\item Evaluation times \& number of traversals in decision tree
	\item Comparison of BFS, BFS and original heuristic, BFS and improved (?) heuristic on the basis of computed time, expended energy, gait characteristics
\end{itemize}
